This is my final project for SURV727 Fundamentals of Computing and Data Display.

# Project Agenda
This was the agenda laid out in the midterm (proposal) presentation.

1. Rank neighborhoods based on property tax assessed vs. home values + service availability and quality (for example, quality of districted schools, public transportation access). 
1a. Create index/"value score" of these factors for ranking purposes
**Intended end product**: Ranked list and map of neighborhoods based on value score

2. Predict neighborhood score based on other factors, such as demographics, urbanicity, etc. to identify connections between these factors and value (not really for prediction, may help to expose biases in either algorithm or allocation of resources!)
**Intended end product**: List of factors highly related to score

3.✨Bonus✨ Identify individual properties with largest gaps in assessed value and actual value
**Intended end product**: List of individual properties with large differences between assessed and actual value

Additional components, suggested by professor ([chkern](https://github.com/chkern)):
- Connect with previous/related research to identify where/why to expect gaps between taxes and services, assessed and actual value.
- Use research to improve index of public services (variable weights for different types of services, for example).
